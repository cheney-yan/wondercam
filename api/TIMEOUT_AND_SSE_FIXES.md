# Timeout and SSE Notification Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Analysis Timeout Problem ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Prompt analysis always timed out after 100ms, causing analysis to never complete.

**Root Cause**: 
- `v2_api_enhanced.py` used hardcoded `timeout=0.1` (100ms)  
- But `prompt_analyzer.py` needs 2-3 seconds for network requests to Vertex AI
- Config had `prompt_analysis_timeout: 20` but this wasn't used for quick analysis

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# config.py - Added quick timeout setting
prompt_analysis_quick_timeout: float = 8.0  # Allow more time since user is notified

# v2_api_enhanced.py - Use configurable timeout
analysis_result = await asyncio.wait_for(analysis_task, timeout=settings.prompt_analysis_quick_timeout)

# prompt_analyzer.py - Reduced network timeout for speed
async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=2.0) as client:  # Was 3.0s
```

### 2. Missing User Notifications ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Users had no indication that analysis was happening, making longer waits confusing.

**Fix Applied**: Added analysis start notifications in user's language:
```python
# vertex_formatter.py - Added analysis start notification
def format_analysis_start_notification(language: str = "en") -> str:
    templates = {
        'en': "🧠 Analyzing your request to provide the best response...",
        'zh': "🧠 正在分析您的请求以提供最佳回应...",
        # ... other languages
    }
```

### 3. Current Flow Now ✅
1. **Immediate OK**: `🤖` sent instantly
2. **Analysis Start**: `🧠 Analyzing your request...` (in user's language)  
3. **Analysis Result**: Either refinement notification or pass-through
4. **Vertex AI Stream**: Normal response streaming

## Remaining Issue ❌

### 4. Missing Refinement Notification and Final Response
**Problem**: User reports "the refined prompt and the final text message from vertex image engine is not transferred back"

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Analysis still timing out** - New 8s timeout might still not be enough
2. **SSE format issue** - Notifications might not be in correct format
3. **Streaming interruption** - Analysis notifications might be blocking Vertex AI stream
4. **Client parsing issue** - Frontend might not be handling all SSE events correctly

**Debug Steps Needed**:
1. Check Docker logs to see if analysis completes within 8s timeout
2. Verify SSE format of refinement notifications
3. Confirm Vertex AI streaming works after notifications
4. Test end-to-end flow with real client

## Configuration Summary

```python
# Current timeout settings
prompt_analysis_enabled: bool = True
prompt_analysis_timeout: int = 20  # Full analysis timeout (not used in quick mode)
prompt_analysis_quick_timeout: float = 8.0  # Quick analysis for responsiveness
```

**Philosophy**: Since we notify users about analysis progress, we can afford longer timeouts (8s) to get better analysis results rather than always timing out (100ms).

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor logs** - Check if 8s timeout is sufficient for analysis completion
2. **Verify SSE format** - Ensure refinement notifications reach client correctly  
3. **Test streaming** - Confirm Vertex AI response streaming works after notifications
4. **Debug client** - Verify frontend handles all SSE events properly

The key improvement is balancing **responsiveness** (immediate OK + progress notifications) with **intelligence** (allowing time for actual analysis to complete).
